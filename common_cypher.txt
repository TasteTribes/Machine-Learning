CALL db.schema.visualization();

view all nodes:
MATCH (n) RETURN n;

count:
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);

how many nodes there are of each label
MATCH (n) RETURN labels(n), count(n);

view just one node:
MATCH (n: Category) RETURN n;

If contains_alcohol is a node and you want to see all nodes related to it:
MATCH (n)-[r]->(c:contains_alcohol)
RETURN n, r, c;

find a node with a specific property:
MATCH (n)
WHERE n.contains_alcohol = true
RETURN n;


Deleting:
Delete nodes with a specific name
MATCH (n:Processed) DETACH DELETE n;

Deleting nodes with a common label:
MATCH (n:ProcessingType)
WHERE n.type IN ["Processed", "Ultra-Processed", "Raw"]
DETACH DELETE n;
